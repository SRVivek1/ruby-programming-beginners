    Logical Operators
    --------------------
        --> Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then âˆ’


        and	
            --> Called Logical AND operator. 
            --> If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true.
                (a and b) is true.

        or	
            --> Called Logical OR Operator. 
            --> If any of the two operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true.
                (a or b) is true.

        &&	
            --> Called Logical AND operator. 
            --> If both the operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true.	
                (a && b) is true.

        ||	
            --> Called Logical OR Operator. 
            --> If any of the two operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true.	
                (a || b) is true.

        !	
            --> Called Logical NOT Operator. 
            --> Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. 
            --> If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.	
                !(a && b) is false.

        not	
            --> Called Logical NOT Operator. 
            --> Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. 
            --> If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.	
                not(a && b) is false.
