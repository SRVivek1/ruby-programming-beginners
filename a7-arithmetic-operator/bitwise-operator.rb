    Bitwise Operators
    -------------------
    Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit by bit operation.

    Assume if 
        a = 60; and 
        b = 13;
    
    Now in binary format they will be as follows âˆ’

    a    =  0011 1100
    b    =  0000 1101
    ------------------
    a&b  =  0000 1100
    a|b  =  0011 1101
    a^b  =  0011 0001
    ~a   =  1100 0011


    &	
        --> Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.	
            (a & b) will give 12, which is 0000 1100
    
    |	
        --> Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	
        (a | b) will give 61, which is 0011 1101

    ^	
        --> Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	
        (a ^ b) will give 49, which is 0011 0001

    ~	
        --> Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	
            (~a ) will give -61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.

    <<	
        Binary Left Shift Operator. 
        The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	
        a << 2 will give 240, which is 1111 0000

    >>	
        Binary Right Shift Operator. 
        The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	
        a >> 2 will give 15, which is 0000 1111
